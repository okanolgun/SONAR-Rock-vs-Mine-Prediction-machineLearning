# SONAR-Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction-machineLearning
Sonar systems are actively used in the defense industry. They can play a very important role in a possible war situation. Today I did a machine learning project using Logistic regression. Logistic regression is a classification model. In today's project, we are trying to predict whether an object caught in the Sonar system at sea will be a mine or a rock.

I got from UCI machine learning repository. It is not as comprehensive as my other projects but it helped me remember some basics. In today's project, we first examined our data, cleaned it and made it ready for our model. We divided the column we wanted to predict and tested our model with training test data. Finally, we took a sample data and checked if our model was working correctly.
